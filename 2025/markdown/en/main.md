## Competition Format

The competition proceeds in this order: team registration, preliminary, main, and final.

### Team Registration

- One team leader registers the team by entering team/member information through the registration link on this page.
- After registration, a confirmation email is sent to the team leader’s representative email address. (If you do not receive it, contact via Slack.)
- During the registration period, the team leader may edit team/member information.
- After registration closes, organizers may request modifications if necessary.

### Preliminary

- Teams ranked high on the leaderboard based on algorithms submitted during the preliminary period are selected for the main stage (about 20–30 teams).

### Main

- Teams ranked high on the leaderboard based on algorithms submitted during the main period are selected for the final stage (10 teams).
- Main-stage teams must submit basic information about their developed algorithm (e.g., mathematical optimization/machine learning/heuristics methodology, optimization solvers and ML libraries used).

### Final

- During the final period, no new algorithm submissions are accepted. Algorithms are evaluated using hidden problems with each team’s last submission from the main stage.
- Final-stage teams will give in-person presentations at the optimization challenge event on 9/19 (Fri).
- Final ranking is determined by combining presentation score and algorithm evaluation score at a fixed ratio.

### Notes

- Regardless of team registration, anyone can download problem descriptions, standard templates for algorithm development, and baseline data from the competition website.
- During the competition period, each team may submit algorithms up to twice per day and check results on the leaderboard.
- Optimization solver licenses needed for development (Gurobi, Xpress) will be provided free upon request by the corresponding vendors (subject to vendor policy).
- Teams can develop on their own PCs based on the standard templates.
- Algorithm evaluation includes execution-time limits.

> Leaderboard rankings are based on each team’s final submitted algorithm.

> After the challenge ends, code and presentation materials from finalist teams may be published on the website (details will be announced later).

> Teams found engaging in misconduct may be excluded from the winner list.
