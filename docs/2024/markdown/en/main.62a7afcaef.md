## Overview

**Optimization Grand Challenge 2024 (OGC2024)** is an algorithm competition focused on solving real-world delivery optimization problems.

### Key Objectives

This competition addresses **Bundle Delivery** optimization, a core challenge in delivery services. Participants must develop algorithms that achieve the following:

- 🚴 **Efficient Order Bundling** - Assign multiple orders to a single delivery rider
- 🗺️ **Optimal Route Planning** - Design routes that minimize time and distance
- ⏰ **Deadline Compliance** - Ensure all orders meet delivery deadlines
- 💰 **Cost Minimization** - Optimize the number of riders and travel distance


### What is Delivery Optimization?

When orders come through a food delivery app, multiple orders must be bundled and assigned to a single delivery rider with an optimal route. The following constraints must be satisfied:

- Each order can be picked up only after its ready time
- All orders must be delivered before their deadline
- Rider capacity limits must be respected
- Travel time and delivery costs must be minimized
