# Source Code Submission, Final Presentation Evaluation, Awards Ceremony Guide

*Update history:*

- *2024/9/28 - announced*
- *2024/10/12 - revised (source code submission added, final presentation material submission guidelines and deadline changed, awards ceremony time typo corrected)*

## 1. Source Code Submission Guide

All teams participating in the final round **must**, **when submitting algorithms from October 14**, compress all source code and readme.txt file together according to the guidelines below and submit (no need to create separate subdirectories).

- **If there are library files that are pre-compiled and used, such as Shared Object files**, you **must submit source code before compilation** and **create a separate plain text readme.txt file describing how to compile**. However, library files provided in the OGC2024 environment cannot have source code uploaded, so those source codes may be excluded.
- **If there are no pre-compiled library files such as Shared Object files but external packages not provided in the OGC2024 environment are used, you must submit source code and describe the packages in the readme.txt file**. **If it is a publicly accessible external package but source code submission is impossible, you must describe the package and access method**.
- **If all files submitted to the system are source code and there are no problems running them in the OGC2024 environment as-is**, you can **briefly write that fact in the readme.txt file and submit**.
- **Warning**: After the final round ends on the 16th, the organizing committee will review the last submitted source code and check if reproduction works through compilation, etc., and please note that disqualification may occur if problems arise. As announced during competition participation, source code will be publicly released to everyone.

## 2. Final Presentation Evaluation Date/Time and Location

**Final presentation evaluation** will be conducted **on the afternoon of the first day (October 24) at the venue of the '2024 Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers Fall Conference' held on October 24-25, 2024**. See conference information ([https://kiie.org](https://kiie.org)).

Details are below, so final round participating teams should understand. Registration for the Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers Fall Conference is not necessary to participate in final presentation evaluation.

- **Final presentation evaluation date/time**: October 24, 2024, 13:20 ~ 16:20
- **Final presentation evaluation location**: Korea Science & Technology Center Convention Center (22 Teheran-ro 7-gil, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, B1 Korea Federation of Science and Technology Societies) Presentation evaluation hall (within 10-minute walk from Gangnam Station and Yeoksam Station on Subway Line 2)
- **Presentation order and time**: Presentation order will be arbitrarily designated by the organizing committee and will be disclosed in the Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers Fall Conference program. **Presentation evaluation time per team is 10 minutes presentation, 5 minutes Q&A** for a maximum of 15 minutes. Presentation is by 1 presenter per team, but Q&A responses can be by team members including the presenter.
- **Dinner after presentation evaluation**: There will be a dinner at 18:00 after final presentation evaluation attended by final participants, competition organizing committee members, etc. The location is planned as the Chinese restaurant on the 2nd basement floor of Korea Science & Technology Center Convention Center, and may change depending on venue circumstances.

> 💡 **Each final round participating team must have a presenter attend** to participate in presentation evaluation. Presenters must **send presentation materials by email to `optichallenge.kiie@gmail.com` by 23:59 on October 23**, **arrive at the evaluation hall 10 minutes before presentation evaluation starts (13:10)**, and **complete preparations such as receiving presenter name tag and loading presentation materials**. **10 minutes presentation, 5 minutes Q&A per team**.

> 💡 Final presenters and dinner attendees will be **surveyed in advance**, and **team leaders of final participating teams** are asked to **reply to emails** sent by the competition organizing committee.

## 3. Final Presentation Material Preparation

Presentation time per team is limited to within 10 minutes. Prepare presentation material file format in PowerPoint or PDF, freely including the following items:

- **Algorithm Logic**: Explain overall algorithm structure and details
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Explain algorithm implementation language, packages used, implementation techniques, etc.
- **Algorithm Strengths**: Explain what the team wants to emphasize about the algorithm (logic + implementation) (e.g., creativity, applicability in various situations, scalability according to problem size, etc.)
- **Algorithm Development Direction**: Introduce algorithm future improvement directions, methods not used due to technical or competition period constraints
- **Competition Participation Review**: Impressions, suggestions, competition future development directions, etc.

> 💡 **Presentation time per team is limited to within 10 minutes**, so **include the above items (logic, implementation, strengths, development direction, participation review)** while considering the time limit when preparing presentation materials

## 4. Final Presentation Evaluation Criteria and Final Score Calculation

Final presentation evaluation is conducted by a judging panel of 2 industry members and 2 academia members evaluating the following items:

- **Algorithm Appropriateness**: Is the algorithm logic appropriate and effective for solving the problem? Is it applicable to various situations such as problem data changes? Evaluated
- **Algorithm Creativity**: Algorithm originality, novelty of approach method, etc. evaluated
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Use of techniques or implementation technologies to increase algorithm execution efficiency, scalability according to problem size, etc. evaluated
- **Presentation**: Presentation material volume, expression, content delivery, Q&A response, etc. evaluated

The judging panel calculates team presentation evaluation scores on a 25-point scale. Team final scores are calculated by combining leaderboard scores (100 points maximum) and presentation evaluation scores (25 points maximum) (80% : 20%). According to final score ranking, 1 grand prize team, 1 best excellence prize team, 2 excellence prize teams, 3 special prize teams, and 3 encouragement prize teams are determined in order, and winners will be announced at the awards ceremony on October 25 (Friday).

## 5. Awards Ceremony Date/Time and Location

The awards ceremony will be held at the Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers Fall Conference general meeting and separate awards ceremony on the second day of the conference (October 25).

- **Awards ceremony date/time**: October 25, 2024, 14:40 ~ 15:00
- **Awards ceremony location**: Korea Science & Technology Center Convention Center (22 Teheran-ro 7-gil, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, B1 Korea Federation of Science and Technology Societies) Grand Hall (within 10-minute walk from Gangnam Station and Yeoksam Station on Subway Line 2)

> 💡 **Each final round participating team must have at least 1 person attend the awards ceremony**. Since there is uncertainty in the event schedule time, **arrive at the venue by 14:30 at the latest** (conference registration is not necessary to attend the awards ceremony)

> 💡 For prize money payment, additional personal information from winners is needed, so necessary information will be collected after the event and paid
