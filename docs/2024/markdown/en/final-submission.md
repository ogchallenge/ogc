# Source Code Submission, Final Presentation Evaluation, and Awards Ceremony

*Update history:*

- *2024/9/28 - announced*
- *2024/10/12 - revised (added source code submission, updated presentation submission instructions and deadlines, fixed award ceremony time typo)*

## 1. Source code submission

All finalist teams **must** submit their full source code and `readme.txt` in a single archive **when submitting algorithms starting Oct 14**, following the guidelines below (no subdirectories are required).

- **If you use pre-compiled libraries (e.g., shared objects)**, you **must submit the original source code** and include a plain text **`readme.txt` describing how to compile**. Libraries provided in the OGC2024 environment do not require source submission.
- **If you use external packages not provided in the OGC2024 environment (but no pre-compiled binaries)**, you must submit the source and describe the package in `readme.txt`. **If the package is publicly accessible but cannot be submitted**, include access instructions and a description instead.
- **If your submission consists only of source code that runs in the OGC2024 environment without extra steps**, note that in `readme.txt`.
- **Note**: After the final stage ends on Oct 16, the organizing committee will review the last submitted source code and attempt to reproduce it through compilation and execution. If issues arise, the team may be disqualified. As announced, source code will be made public.

## 2. Final presentation evaluation schedule and venue

**Final presentation evaluation** will take place on Oct 24-25, 2024, during the **2024 KIIE Fall Conference**, on **Oct 24 (Day 1, afternoon)** at the conference venue. See conference info at [https://kiie.org](https://kiie.org).

## 3. Final presentation materials

Each team has up to 10 minutes. Use PowerPoint or PDF and include the following (you may choose the style freely):

- **Algorithm logic**: Overall structure and details
- **Implementation**: Language, packages, techniques
- **Strengths**: What you want to emphasize (creativity, applicability, scalability, etc.)
- **Future improvements**: Ideas you could not use during the competition
- **Reflections**: Participation experience and suggestions

> 💡 Keep the presentation within **10 minutes** and include the items above (logic, implementation, strengths, future work, reflections).

## 4. Final presentation evaluation criteria and scoring

The evaluation panel (2 industry, 2 academia) scores the following:

- **Appropriateness**: Is the logic suitable and effective? Can it handle varying scenarios?
- **Creativity**: Originality and novelty of the approach
- **Efficiency**: Techniques or implementations to improve runtime and scalability
- **Presentation**: Structure, clarity, delivery, and Q&A

Each team receives a presentation score out of 25. The final score is computed by combining the leaderboard score (100 points) and the presentation score (25 points) with a fixed ratio (80% : 20%). Final awards are determined by total score: 1 Grand Prize, 1 Excellence Award, 2 Outstanding Awards, 3 Special Awards, and 3 Encouragement Awards.
